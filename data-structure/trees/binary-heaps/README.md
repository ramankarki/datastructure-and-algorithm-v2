# Binary Heaps

Every left and right is filled before we move down and left children is filled out first.

<br>

## Time complexity

### Insert, Remove - O(n \* log n)

### Search - O(n)

<br>

## Min heaps

Parent node is always smaller than children node.

<br>

## Max heaps

Parent node is always greater than children node.

<br>

# Use case

Binarh heaps are used to implement priority queues, which are very commonly used data structure.

# Priority Queue

A data structure where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.
