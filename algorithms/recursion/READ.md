# When to use it

- When we can easily breakdown a problem into similar subproblem.
- When we are fine with extra overhead (both time & space) that comes with it.
- When we need a quick working solution instead of efficient one.
- When traversing a tree.
- When we use memoization in recursion.

# When not to use it

- If time and space complexity matters for us.
- Recursion can be slow.
